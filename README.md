# Overview
This course is about cities and how they affect our lives. Specifically, this course looks at: Theories of urban space and place in cities, 2) social and physical environments of cities, 3) how inequality and diversity constructed in cities, and 4) cities of today and the future. Moreover, the course discusses how city space (and the structural characteristics) shape the spatial patterns of crime. The course considers the principal theoretical perspectives that link crime to urban place, as well as the research methods that have been used to study cities and crime in place, including classic and contemporary theoretical and methodological discourses from interdisciplinary social science fields including urban sociology, urban planning, urban geography, architecture design, and criminology.

# Student Responsibilities & Expectations
- Students are expected to come to class having read the reading assignments, to be attentive and ready to learn, to participate in class discussions with pertinent questions and ideas, and to be respectful of fellow students. Classroom disturbances like personal conversations and ringing cell phones are not welcome.
- Cell phone use is prohibited except for classroom use. Laptops and tablet computers may be used for taking notes. If you cannot avoid the temptation of the Internet, please sit in the back of the room so that you do not distract other students. Students in violation of this policy may be asked to leave class.
- Attendance – All students are expected to attend every class. Since exams cover readings and lectures, missing multiple classes will likely result in a reduced final grade. If you do miss a class, you should always copy notes from a classmate. Lecture PowerPoint slides are provided on Canvas. The instructor will not share his complete notes (but I may meet with you to discuss the material if you have any questions). 
- Make-up Policy – Make-up exams will not be given except in cases of a documented medical problem/emergency, death in the family, or a religious holiday. Proper written documentation is required. In such cases, the student must contact the instructor before class. Failure to abide by these rules will result in a grade of zero. 
- Religious Observances – If you are unable to take any exams or turn in any assignments due to a religious observance, you will need to discuss this with me at least one week prior to the due date/exam date. 
- Disability Support – Any student with a documented disability (it must be documented by Office of Accessibility Services) must provide this documentation to the instructor via the OAS system. Out of fairness to all students, I will not accommodate students who do not provide me with written documentation from the OAS. Students with the OAS documentation who are requesting to take their exams at the OAS testing center need to contact the OAS in a timely manner and schedule the alternative testing there. Otherwise, the student is expected to take the exam at the same time as the rest of the class. If a student wants to take the exam at the OAS testing center, the exam time and date must be the same date and time as the regular exam time/date. 
- Academic Integrity – Students are expected to adhere to Florida State University’s Academic Honor Policy (https://fda.fsu.edu/academic-resources/academic-integrity-andgrievances/academic-honor-policy). Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and any violations will be reported to the FDA office by the instructor. If deemed severe enough, the student will then be referred to the Academic Honor Policy Committee at FSU. Academic dishonesty includes cheating, fabrication of information used in assignments, plagiarism, and knowingly facilitating the dishonesty of another student.
- Classroom Code of Conduct – Students are required to be courteous to one another and to the instructor. Any student who engages in disruptive behavior will be asked to leave the classroom and will lose classroom participation points in addition to an additional point from one’s final grade. Being disruptive includes repeatedly coming late to class, leaving the classroom during lecture without authorization, making loud or distracting noises, sleeping, speaking without being recognized, reading outside material, and talking on cell phones or text messaging. 
- Copyright – The lectures I deliver in this class and the course materials I create and distribute are protected by federal copyright law. My lectures are delivered from written lectured notes in order to ensure my copyright protection. You are permitted to take notes from my lectures and to use course materials for this class. You may not record, reproduce, or distribute my lectures/notes for any commercial purpose without my written consent. Persons who sell or distribute copies or modified copies of my course materials, possess commercial copies of my notes, or assist another person or entity in selling or distributing those materials will be reported to the university.

# Resources
- University Attendance Policy
Excused absences include documented illness, deaths in the family and other documented crises, call to active military duty or jury duty, religious holy days, and official University activities. These absences will be accommodated in a way that does not arbitrarily penalize students who have a valid excuse. Consideration will also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness.

# COVID Language 
•	We expect everyone to wear a face covering or mask at all times when inside any FSU facility, even if you are vaccinated. This includes all of our students, faculty, staff, vendors and visitors. Recent studies and guidance from the CDC state that both unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals can transmit the current COVID-19 variant to unvaccinated persons. We expect you to help mitigate the spread by wearing a mask.
•	We expect everyone to be vaccinated against COVID-19, even if you’ve had COVID-19 in the past. If possible, aim to be fully vaccinated, but if unable, strive to have at least one shot of Pfizer or Moderna vaccine no later than August 22. Please visit vaccine.fsu.edu for walk-in clinic dates and hours at the Tucker Center in Tallahassee or vaccines.gov to locate a COVID-19 vaccine provider near you.
•	We expect you to stay home when sick, self-quarantine and get tested for COVID-19 no sooner than 24 hours after your symptoms begin. You can test for no cost at the Tucker Center. Schedule your test at uhs.fsu.edu/coronavirus/testing.
•	And finally, we expect you to continue to practice good hygiene habits such as washing your hands frequently.
